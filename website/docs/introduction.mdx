Vale is a command-line tool that brings code-like linting to prose. It's
_open source_, _fast_, and _highly customizable_.

:memo: It doesn't attempt to teach you _how_ to write; it's a tool _for_ writers. In
other words, Vale focuses on allowing its users to create their own collections
of rules (known as [_styles_](/vale/styles)) rather than providing its own
advice.

:lock: It's 100% offline, private, and secure. While other tools and services
have to explain to you how they will/won't use your data (often in long,
legalese-filled documents), all we have to say is that [we don't have access
to it](#privacy).

:package: It's a standalone, [easy-to-install](/vale/install) binary. Unlike other tools, Vale
doesn't require you to install and configure a particular programming language
and its related tooling (such as Python/pip or Node.js/npm).

## Community

## Privacy

Privacy is an important consideration in all Vale-related development
decisions. We've gone to great lengths to ensure that our software has the
utmost respect for our users and their content.

For us, it's not merely about what we *say*&mdash;it's about what we *do*.

### Vale

The [Vale command-line tool][5] serves as the foundation (functionality-wise)
for all of our software and integrations. It's free, open source, and
[permissively licensed][6].

Vale is distributed as a self-contained, standalone binary, and it works
entirely **offline**: We have absolutely **zero** access to any content linted
by Vale.

### Vale Server

[Vale Server][7] is a graphical user interface (GUI), web-based dashboard, and
HTTP server built on top of Vale.

It runs on [`localhost`][8] and uses a local `vale` executable to perform all
of its linting, so it also inherits all of Vale's content-related privacy
guarantees.

### Integrations

When you use Vale with a third-party integration, you also need to consider
their own security and privacy policies.

Wherever possible, we try to abide by the strictest level of security
practices. For example, see our blog post, [*Taking Vale Server to the web*][14],
in which we describe how Vale's Chrome extension achieved the *very rare*
distinction of being warning-free according to Google.
